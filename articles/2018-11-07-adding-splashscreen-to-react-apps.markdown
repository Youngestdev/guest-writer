**TL;DR:** In this article, you will learn how to add splash screen to your React single page apps (SPA). You can find the finalized code in [this GitHub repo]()

## What Is A Splash Screen 

A splash screen is a page displayed to notify a user when an application is currently in a loading state. In most cases, splash screens are employed when data is fetched from within or outside the application e.g database . The splash screen, serves as a replacement for blank pages which is usually shown when loading data externally.

## Why Your App Should Have A Splash Screen

In your application, a splash screen should be added to indicate when your app is loading and to tell the user that the app isn't dormant. In a situation whereby your loading app shows a blank page for about a minute or two, the user will get bored and loose interest thinking it is a dummy app whereas the splash screen does otherwise. Therefore, adding a splash screen to your application keeps the user engaged while your app loads fully.

### Brief Introduction to React's Higher-Order Component

A Higher-Order Component ( HOC ), is a function that takes in a component as an argument and returns a new component. A higher-order component is usually used to share common functionality between components such as checking the authentication status in a web app.

An example of a higher-order component is the splash screen component which you'll be using later.

## Cloning The Sample App repo

To begin, you'll have to clone [this repo](https://github.com/Youngestdev/react-splashscreen) and follow the installation process in the `README.MD` file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Youngestdev/react-splashscreen
```

## Building the Splash Screen Component

After the installation, start the application :

```bash
npm run start
```

With that covered, open the project directory in your code editor of choice and create a new file `withSplashScreen.js` in the `src/Components` folder.

Next, open the `withSplashScreen.js` file and add the following into it :

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import { CircleSpinner } from 'react-spinners-kit';
import auth0Client from '../Auth';
import firebaseClient from '../services/firebase';


const fbTokenFactory = 'https://wt-21d474de14a60e389a0fa7c8e77c224f-0.sandbox.auth0-extend.com/webtasks/firebase';

function LoadingMessage() {
  return (
    <div className="row justify-content-center">
      <CircleSpinner color="#686769" />
    </div>
  );
}

function withSplashScreen(WrappedComponent) {
  return class extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        loading: true,
      };
    }

    async componentDidMount() {
      try {
        await auth0Client.loadSession();
        const fbCustomToken = await axios.get(fbTokenFactory, {
          headers: { authorization: `Bearer ${auth0Client.getIdToken()}` }
        });
        firebaseClient.setToken(fbCustomToken.data.firebaseToken)
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }
      this.setState({
        loading: false,
      });
    }

    render() {
      // while checking user session, show "loading" message
      if (this.state.loading) return LoadingMessage();

      // otherwise, show the desired route
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
}

export default withSplashScreen;

```

In the code above, you define a function `LoadingMessage()` that displays a circle spinner after which a higher-order component `withSplashScreen` that handles the authentication and data fetching is defined.

## Wrapping The Application With The Splash Screen Component

With the splash screen component built, it's not yet functional therefore, you'll wrap the `App` component in `App.js` in the `withSplashScreen` function since it's a higher-order component.

Open `App.js` and replace the code with :

```javascript
import React, {Component, Fragment} from 'react';
import {Route} from 'react-router-dom'
import NavBar from './components/NavBar';
import Welcome from './components/Welcome';
import withSplashScreen from './components/withSplashScreen';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Fragment>
        <NavBar />
        <div className="container-fluid">
          <Route path="/" exact component={Welcome} />
        </div>
      </Fragment>
    );
  }
}

export default withSplashScreen(App);

```

In the code above, you deleted the callback route because you won't be needing it anymore.

Next, open the `Frameworks.js` file in `src/Components` and replace the code with this :

```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import firebaseClient from '../services/firebase';
import {CircleSpinner} from 'react-spinners-kit';

function Framework(framework, id) {
  return (
    <div className="row" key={id}>
      <div className="card">
        <div className="card-body">
          <h5 className="card-title">{framework.name}</h5>
          <hr className="my-4" />
          <p className="card-text">{framework.about}</p>
        </div>            
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

class Frameworks extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      frameworks: [],
      loading: true
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    firebaseClient.setBuildingsListener(querySnapshot => {
      const frameworks = [];
      querySnapshot.forEach(framework => {
        frameworks.push(framework.data());
      });
      this.setState({
        frameworks,
        loading: false
      });
    });
  }

  render() {
    const {loading, frameworks} = this.state;
    return (
      <div>
        {loading && <CircleSpinner color="" />}
        {!loading && frameworks.map((framework, id) => (Framework(framework, id)))}
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Frameworks;
```

In the code above, you updated the `Frameworks` component by adding a circle spinner to show the loading state.

## Refactoring The Authentication Handler

With all that in place, you need to update the authentication handler to go along with the changes made. Therefore, open `Auth.js` file and edit the eigth line from `'http://localhost:3000/callback'` to `'http://localhost:3000'.`

## Running Application

With all that covered, you have successfully added a splash screen to your app. Refresh the apps page in your browser and feel the splash screen effect.

## Conclusion

Implementing splash screens isn't a big deal and is relatively easy. Therefore, try to implement splash screens in your web apps to improve user experience. Happy hacking!
